								Like many adults, I have taken to "doomscrolling" Twitter during the Pandemic.  It was weird when I ran into this post.  As I am old I do not have TikTok, but I was fascinated to hear that a) TikTok is still a thing and b) something good thing happened there

He has Parkinson's Disease which drove him to do burpees, so much so that he recently broke a World Record!

							<p>Brian Alldridge saw the video, it upset him and he posted this response</p> 
							<p>He directs country music videos and describes himself as "The CEO of Snapple Facts".  He doesn't have a 3D printer or experience with 3D design in Fusion 360</p>
							<p>And yet, he had an idea for a better design and taught himself Fusion 360 to bring it to life</p>

					<h4>Consider watching this VICE video from 2020</h4>

						<li>Consumer 3D printing has never really taken off, but is popular with "nerdy hobbyists" (mild offense taken)</li>
						<li>Still, 3D printing has continued to get cheaper, easier, and more advanced</li>
						<li>Commercial manufacturing uses make sense</li>
						<li>Certain use cases like space travel are particularly well suited for 3D printing</li>

					<h4>Maker Coin</h4>
					<p>If all went to plan you received a 3D printed Maker Coin, similar to the image on the first slide, in the mail from me.  I hope the chain makes it easy to attach to a backpack or keychain, it would make my day to see one of my Rutherford the Owl Maker Coins "in the wild"!</p>
					<p>I learned about this project from Angus, whose YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQbYGpbdrh-b2ND-AfIybg" target="_blank"><em>Makers Muse</em></a> has 730k subscribers.  I think he does a great job, watch the video:</p>

					<h4>What about the "Challenge" part of this?</h4>
					<p>The challenge is for you to design your own Maker Coin!</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Rule #1: do not spend any money on software or a 3D printer</li>
						<li>Rule #2: in total this is a challenging project.  There is no rush.  Try your best not to get frustrated, stick with it</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Many "nerdy hobbyists" like to use <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal" target="_blank">Fusion 360</a>.  Brian used it for the pill bottle.  Angus will walk you thru how to design your Maker Coin in Fusion 360.  You may need an adult's help to install Fusion 360 onto a home computer.  If you cannot install software on your computer, or if you already know and like <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com" target="_blank">TinkerCad</a> this is a perfectly fine alternative</p>
					<p>I skipped this part because I had Rutherford the Owl art, but Angus uses <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0.2/">InkScape</a> to put a logo on the coin in his tutorial</p>
					<p>Ask an adult for help if you need to install software and remember both Rule #1 and #2!</p>

					<h4>Maker Coin Design in Fusion 360</h4>
					<p>I had to pause, rewind and rewatch this video a number of times...stick with it!</p>

					<h4>Wrap Up</h4>
					<p>I hope you enjoyed this presentation, and that it might get you excited to learn more about 3D printing and design!</p>
					<p>If you were able to design your Maker Coin and you would like it printed please export an STL format file, change the filename to be your name, and upload it here.  I will print it out and mail it to you!  At this point I have <a href="https://www.proto-pasta.com/products/wonder-blue-glitter-flake-htpla?_pos=6&_sid=d8d000c0f&_ss=r">glitter blue</a>, <a href="https://www.proto-pasta.com/products/nebula-multicolor-htpla?_pos=11&_sid=d8d000c0f&_ss=r">nebula</a>, <a href="https://www.proto-pasta.com/products/glitter-flake-htpla-v2-candy-apple-red?_pos=4&_sid=ccdb50bf4&_ss=r">candy apple red</a>, <a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/de/prusament/928-prusament-petg-neon-green-transparent-1kg.html">transparent neon green</a>, <a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/de/prusament/1006-prusament-petg-prusa-galaxy-black-1kg.html">galaxy black</a>, <a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/de/prusament/957-prusament-petg-ultramarine-blue-transparent-1kg.html">ultramarine transparent blue</a>, orange, and clear filaments on hand.  If you feel strongly include the color of your preference in the filename.  I hope this print will proudly enter your collection of completed Maker Day projects!</p>
					<p>I sincerely wish you all a boring, normal, vaccinated future and I look forward to more Maker Days to come!  I think we can use the lessons learned here to design wheels for derby cars.  I also hope to follow Brian and Jimmy's examples on resiliency and problem solving.  Miss you all, take care.</p>
