							<p>I'm excited you are here to learn more about 3D printing and design!  It's a great skill and Pandemic optimized to boot.</p>
							<p>If all went to plan you should have received a Maker Coin printed in <a href="https://www.proto-pasta.com/collections/all/products/wonder-blue-glitter-flake-htpla" target="_blank">fancy filament</a> similar to this one in the mail. Hopefully the chain makes it easy to attach to a backpack or keychain.</p>

						<li>Consumer 3D printing has never really taken off, but it is popular with "nerdy hobbyists" (ðŸ¤¨ mild offense taken)</li>
						<li>3D printing has continued to get cheaper, easier, and more advanced</li>
						<li>Commercial manufacturing use cases make sense</li>
						<li>3D printing is uniquely well suited for use cases like space travel</li>

					<h4>What is a Maker Coin?</h4>
					<p>Check out Angus on his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQbYGpbdrh-b2ND-AfIybg" target="_blank"><em>Makers Muse</em></a>, which has 730k subscribers, and watch this video where he explains the Maker Coin:</p>

					<h4>What about the "Challenge" part of this?</h4>
					<p>The challenge is for you to design your own Maker Coin!</p>
					<p>The rules are:
						<ol>
							<li>Do not spend any money on a 3D printer (I will print your project)</li>
							<li>Do not spend any money on software (free versions are sufficient)</li>
							<li>Ask an adult for help/permission installing software</li>
							<li>In total this is a challenging project.  There is no rush.  Try your best not to get frustrated, stick with it</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal" target="_blank">Fusion 360</a> is very powerful, and it's popular both with hobbyists and professionals.  Brian used it for the pill bottle.  Angus will walk you thru how to design your Maker Coin in Fusion 360.  If you cannot install software on your computer, or if you already know and like <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com" target="_blank">TinkerCad</a>, this is a perfectly fine alternative</p>
					<p>Angus uses <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0.2/">InkScape</a> in his tutorial to add a logo, please use whatever art software you are comfortable with</p>

					<h4>Maker Coin Design in Fusion 360</h4>
					<p>I had to pause, rewind, and rewatch this video a number of times...stick with it!</p>

					<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>
					<p>Congrats on making it this far!  If you would like your Maker Coin printed, please export an STL format file, then complete <a href="https://forms.gle/gdD8hdw49a9LPRZS8" target="_blank">this form</a>. If it's a valid Maker Coin, Baby Yoda and I will print and ship you your project.  Best wishes on all fronts and see you post-Pandemic!</p>
